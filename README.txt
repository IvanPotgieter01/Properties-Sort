PROJECT TITLE: Properties Sort

VERSION or DATE: 21/05/2022

AUTHORS: Ivan Potgieter

USER INSTRUCTIONS:
When the program runs, data is read from the properties.txt text file. The properties are then sorted according to type (business and residential). The sorted properties are displayed with appropriate headings. The residential houses that are townhouses are printed to another text file (townhouses.txt) with the relevant information such as owner's name and rent per month.
